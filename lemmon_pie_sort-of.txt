I write this as snow falls outside and winds whip around my house at 50 mph. Despite the current weather conditions, the calendar says spring and Easter are on the horizon. And as someone who lives and breathes her daily planner, that means it�s time to prepare for the change of seasons. Close up that fireplace, place some tulips in a vase, open those windows� whoa that wind! Let�s keep them closed!

Let�s welcome a fresh new season with a fresh new pie� the pie I�ve been taunting you with for weeks!! The beautiful, the timeless, the Classic Lemon Meringue Pie. ?

And there you  have it...
